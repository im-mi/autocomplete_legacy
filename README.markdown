# Autocomplete (Legacy)

This is an extension for [Shimmie](https://github.com/shish/shimmie2/) which re-introduces the old autocompleter, [jquery-autocomplete](https://github.com/dyve/jquery-autocomplete).

It adds a few additional features such as:
- Show tag counts
- Autocomplete negative tags
- Sort tags based on usage
