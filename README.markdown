# Autocomplete (Legacy)

This is an extension for [Shimmie](https://github.com/shish/shimmie2/) which re-introduces the old autocompleter, [jquery-autocomplete](https://github.com/dyve/jquery-autocomplete).

It also has additional features:
- Show and sort tags by their usage counts
- Autocomplete negative tags
- Support multi-line text inputs
- Show more results in less area (make the window fixed-size and scrollable)
- Work with fixed-position input fields (attach directly to the parent element)
- Have better performance (limit the number of results, have a cache system that actually works)
... and more.

Note that many of these features can be adjusted inside script.js.
